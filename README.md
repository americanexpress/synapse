# Synapse
- Tired of having the developers in your team not following the same standards and each of them doing things their own way? 
- Tired of having a disorganized architecture almost impossible to maintain after just a few months of starting your project?
- Tired of struggling on how to start a new project and setting up all the foundational architecture? 
- Tired of spending countless hours, days, or months in getting your foundational frameworks robust and reliable? 

If any of these sound like situations you have experienced or experiences that you simply want to avoid, then Synapse is what you need.

Synapse is a set of lightweight modules designed to help developers build out applications. The modules serve as a wide range tool-suite for developers to facilitate rapid development, with high quality built-in.
It is designed with the purpose of helping developers create web services in a quick and easy way following strict conventions.
Synapse provides an abstraction layer that enforces developers to follow SOLID principles and avoid common mistakes during the development process.
It is based on keeping things SIMPLE and clear. The framework strongly encourages convention over configuration, while highlighting the criticality of structure. 
Although Synapse will cover a majority of the scenarios you will need when creating an enterprise-grade application, it is also very open to extension. 
We encourage you to extend and implement the abstraction layer of this framework. Furthermore, if you feel the need to create a new feature not covered here, you also have that flexibility.

## Synapse Architecture
![Synapse Architecture](docs/assets/synapse-architecture.png)

### Synapse Modules:
#### synapse-service-rest
- This synapse module is the gateway framework module used to expose RESTful APIs. 
It provides several out-of the box functionalities like:

    - An open to extension generic set of open to extension five base crud controller classes to easily build any CRUD Controller by just extending the required base CRUD Controller class.
    - An open to extension generic set of open to extension five base crud service classes to easily build any CRUD Concrete Service class by just extending the required base CRUD Service class and overriding the protected abstract method by it.

- Encapsulates the common utility classes that can be leveraged by any module.
It provides several out-of-the-box functionalities like:

    - A default object mapper defined in its configuration file
-----

## Benefits on-top Spring 
- The Synapse framework is an extension of Spring that uses best practices to force compliance to good standards, while also simplifying the development process. 
These are several of the benefits it provides on-top of what Spring already provides:
    - Creates a very structured and organized architecture very easy to follow by anyone, junior and senior developers.
    - Enforces developers to follow the same template and good standards across the entire code base.
    - Forces strict separation of concerns because the base 'Hook' classes which the developers extend from are already representing each layer in the famous and already proven three layer architecture.
            - Base<Crud functionality>Controller (Http Layer).
            - Base<Crud functionality>Service (Sevice Layer).
            - BaseRestClient, BaseSoapClient or Repositories(These are already interfaces so not base classes provided) (DAO Layer).
    - Provides the BaseControllerTest class with a set of overloaded methods to facilitate controllers slice testing.
    - Provides a couchbase library to build dynamic queries based on Spring Data and Query DSL (There is nothing like this out there).
    - Provides a ControllersExceptionHandlers that handles most of the common exceptions.
    - Provides an elegant and very simple to use exception handling mechanism with only two custom runtime exceptions that covers all the possible scenarios.
    - Provides a generic way to connect to any relational database, using h2 for local and unit tests. And leave free the use of any desired relational database for other environments.

## 🚀‍ Quick Start 
### Building an Enterprise Ready RESTful Web Service utilizing Synapse

### What you will build

This guide walks you through the process of creating a “Hello, World” RESTful web service with Synapse.

It will respond with a JSON representation of a greeting, as the following listing shows:

```json
   {"message": "Hello, World!"}
```

You can customize the greeting with an optional name parameter in the query string, as the following listing shows:

```http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=User```

The name parameter value overrides the default value of World and is reflected in the response, as the following listing shows:

```json
   {"message": "Hello, User!"}
```

### What You Need
- About 15 minutes
- A favorite text editor or IDE
- JDK 1.8+
- Gradle 4+ or Maven 3.2+

You can also import the code straight into your IDE:
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Spring Tool Suite (STS)

 ### Create a Resource Representation class
 
Now that you have set up the project and build system, you can create your web service.

Begin the process by thinking about service interactions.

The service will handle POST requests for /greetings, optionally with a name parameter 
in the query string. The POST request should return a 200 OK response with JSON in the body that represents a greeting. 
It should resemble the following output:
  
```json
   {"message": "Hello, User!"}
```

The id field is a unique identifier for the greeting, and content is the textual representation of the greeting.

To model the greeting representation, create a resource representation class. To do so, provide a plain old Java object with fields, constructors, 
and accessors for the id and content data, as the following listing (from src/main/java/com/example/restservice/Greeting.java) shows:

Below is the request model. 

```java
package com.example.synapse.bookstore.model;

import BaseServiceRequest;

import java.util.Objects;

public class GreetingRequest extends BaseServiceRequest {

    private String name;

    public GreetingRequest(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) return true;
        if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;

        GreetingRequest that = (GreetingRequest) o;

        return Objects.equals(name, that.name);
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return name != null ? name.hashCode() : 0;
    }
}

```


Below is the response model. 

```java
package com.example.synapse.bookstore.model;

import BaseServiceResponse;
import java.util.Objects;

public class GreetingResponse extends BaseServiceResponse {

    private String message;

    public GreetingResponse(String message) {
        this.message = message;
    }

    public String getMessage() {
        return message;
    }

    public void setMessage(String message) {
        this.message = message;
    }


    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "GreetingResponse{" +
                "message='" + message + '\'' +
                '}';
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) return true;
        if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;

        GreetingResponse that = (GreetingResponse) o;

        return Objects.equals(message, that.message);
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return message != null ? message.hashCode() : 0;
    }
}
```

```java
package com.example.synapse.bookstore;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

/**
 * <code>GreetingApplication</code> class that runs this service.
 *
 * @author Gabriel Jimenez
 */
@SpringBootApplication
public class GreetingApplication {

    /**
     * Run the application as a SpringBoot application.
     *
     * @param args program arguments
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(GreetingApplication.class, args);
    }

}

```


### Create a Resource Controller
In Spring’s approach to building RESTful web services, HTTP requests are handled by a controller. 
These components are identified by the @RestController annotation, and the GreetingController 
shown in the following listing (from src/main/java/com/example/restservice/GreetingController.java)
 handles GET requests for /greeting by returning a new instance of the Greeting class:

```java
package com.example.synapse.bookstore.controller;

import BaseController;
import com.example.synapse.bookstore.model.GreetingRequest;
import com.example.synapse.bookstore.model.GreetingResponse;
import com.example.synapse.bookstore.service.GreetingService;
import io.swagger.annotations.Api;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;


/**
 * <code>GreetingController</code> class is the controller that handles the greeting requests.
 * on the endpoint /greetings
 *
 * @author Gabriel Jimenez
 */
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/greetings")
@Api(value = "Greeting API", tags = "Greeting")
public class GreetingController extends BaseController<GreetingRequest, GreetingResponse, GreetingService> {
}
```

### Create a API Config 

```java
package com.example.synapse.bookstore.config;

import com.americanexpress.synapse.service.rest.config.BaseServiceRestConfig;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.ComponentScan;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Import;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.PropertySource;
import org.springframework.web.servlet.config.annotation.WebMvcConfigurer;

/**
 * <code>GreetingConfig</code> class sets configurations used in this module.
 *
 * @author Gabriel Jimenez
 */
@Configuration
@PropertySource("classpath:/service-greeting-application.properties")
@Import({BaseServiceRestConfig.class})
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example.synapse.bookstore")
public class GreetingConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {
}
```

### Create a Resource Service


```java
package com.example.synapse.bookstore.service;

import ServiceHeaders;
import BaseService;
import com.example.synapse.bookstore.model.GreetingRequest;
import com.example.synapse.bookstore.model.GreetingResponse;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

import static java.util.Objects.nonNull;

/**
 * The <code>GreetingService</code> class is responsible handling the business logic of the Greeting API. 
 */
@Service
public class GreetingService extends BaseService<GreetingRequest, GreetingResponse> {

    private static final String template = "Hello, %s!";

    @Override
    protected GreetingResponse getResource(ServiceHeaders headers, GreetingRequest request) {
        if (nonNull(request.getName())) {
            return new GreetingResponse(String.format(template, request.getName()));
        } else {
            return new GreetingResponse(String.format(template, "World!"));
        }
    }
}
```

Now make sure to set your environment to `local`: 

### Summary
Congratulations! You built a simple web application utilizing Synapse and learned how it can ramp up your development pace.
