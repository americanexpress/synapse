/**
 * {@code DeepCopyUtils} class is used to perform a deep copy of one object
 * into a possibly different object. For example, an object of class A with String field 'a'
 * can be deep copied into another object of class B with String field 'a'.
 * <p>
 * Nested objects, maps, collections and so forth can also be deep copied. You should primarily
 * use this class for this purpose. If the object model doesn't contain nested objects,
 * consider using Spring's BeanUtils.copyProperties().
 * <p>
 * If you need to perform a deep clone of objects of the same class,
 * please override Object.clone() in your object model.
