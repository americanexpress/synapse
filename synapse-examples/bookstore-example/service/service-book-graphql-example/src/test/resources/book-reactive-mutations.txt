# How to Run These Sample Queries:
# 1. Run BookApplication as a Java application.
# 2. On your web browser, navigate to GraphiQL via http://localhost:8080/graphiql
# 3. In GraphiQL, paste these all of these queries below.
# 4. Press the "play" button and select the query that you wish to run.

# Note: for example purposes, we have added the word "Reactively" to distinguish the reactive mutations
# from the non-reactive mutations, but you do not need add this word in your implementation.

# Create a new book
# In the Query Variables window, specify the book to be created:
# {
#   "book": {
#     "title": "Fred's Flyers",
#     "author": "Fred Doe"
#   }
# }
mutation createBookReactively($book: BookInput!) {
  
  # Create a new book
  createBookReactively(book: $book) {
    id
    title
    author
  }
}

# Update an existing book
